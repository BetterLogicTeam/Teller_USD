The Smart Contract code passed the audit successfully. We were given a contract code. And we have used all possible tests based on given objects as files. So, it is good to go for production. Since possible test cases can be unlimited for such extensive smart contract protocol, hence we provide no such guarantee of future outcomes. We have used all the latest static tools and manual observations to cover maximum possible test cases to scan everything. Smart contracts within the scope were manually reviewed and analyzed with static analysis tools. Smart Contract’s high-level description of functionality was presented in Quick Stat section of the report. 
Audit report contains all found security vulnerabilities and other issues in the reviewed code.
